# Large-Scale-Data-Processing-and-Analysis-with-Hadoop-and-Sqoop

## Log Processing in Hadoop
- Developed and deployed a Hadoop Streaming job to categorize log entries by severity (INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL) for each minute, enhancing log analysis with real-time categorization.

## ETL with Sqoop and MapReduce
- Automated ETL pipeline to import airline data with Sqoop, processed in Hadoop to calculate minimum, maximum, and average delays by carrier, achieving data insights efficiently.

## Secondary Sorting in MapReduce
- Implemented a two-step MapReduce process to sort word counts in descending order using Hadoopâ€™s sorting mechanism, achieving efficient large-scale data ordering and word frequency analysis.
